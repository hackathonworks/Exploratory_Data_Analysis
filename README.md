# Timeseries Analysis
## Stock Data | Exploratory DataAnalysis | Flask Web Application

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Flask-based Stock Data Analysis Web Application. This web app leverages the yfinance library to fetch historical stock data based on user inputs, including the stock symbol, data aggregation interval, and the desired date range for analysis. It is designed to provide users with a quick and easy way to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on stock data directly from their web browser.


## How to use this application?

This application contains an ipynb notebook.

Install packages as specified in the notebook.

I tested this code in local Jupyter Environment in localhost. Hence, I recommend you to install anaconda and try the code in jupyter notebook/ jupyter lab.
